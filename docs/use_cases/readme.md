# Use Cases

There are a wide variety and many different use cases for information retrieval and vector-powered retrieval systems.  

Our use cases include:
- Different examples of problems you can solve using vector retrieval, improving performance in your ML Stack
- Case studies written by practioners sharing their experiences working with these systems
- Deep dives into specific parts of the ML pipeline, highlighting key considerations when moving vector-driven outputs and experiments into production

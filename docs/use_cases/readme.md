# Use Cases

There are many different use cases for how you can employ information retrieval and vector powered retrieval systems in your products. 

In this section, you can find
- Different examples of problems you can solve using vector retrieval in your ML Stack to improve performance
- Case studies written by practioners sharing their experiences working with these systems
- Deep dives into specific parts of the ML pipeline to highlight important things to be aware of when moving vector driven outputs and experiments into production

# Use Cases

There are many different use cases for how you can employ information retrieval and vector powered retrieval systems in your products. 

In this section, you can find
- Different examples of problems you can solve using vector retrieval in your ML Stack to improve performance
- Case studies written by practioners sharing their experiences working with these systems
- Deep dives into specific parts of the ML pipeline to highlight important things to be aware of when moving vector driven outputs and experiments into production

We are always looking to expand the use cases and share the latest thinking. So if you have been working on something and would like to share your experiences with the community, you can contribute [here](https://github.com/superlinked/VectorHub).

# Retrieval from Image and Text Modalities

## Multimodal embedding: the value add

In the contemporary data-centric world, embeddings have become indispensable for converting complex and varied data into numerical representations that are both manageable and analytically powerful. Utilized [across a spectrum of industries](https://mccormickml.com/2018/06/15/applying-word2vec-to-recommenders-and-advertising/), from e-commerce to healthcare, these embeddings enable machines to interpret, analyze, and make predictions from large-scale datasets, encompassing both textual and visual information. Traditionally, models have relied on unimodal data, focusing on a single type of input. However, the advent of multimodal models, which synergize various data forms such as text and images, has proven to be a game-changer. These multimodal approaches surpass the limitations of unimodal methods, offering richer contextual insights and enhanced predictive capabilities, and paving the way for more sophisticated and accurate applications across diverse sectors. 

Below, we do various text and image embedding experiments using COCO and Open Images V7 datasets, showcasing different unimodal and multimodal embedding models and assessing their effectiveness using ranking metrics. By the end, you'll have an understanding of how to embed multimodal data (...for use in... object detection, segmentation, image captioning??), but also a comparative evaluation of unimodal vs. multimodal embedding performance, as well as how different multimodal models (...rank in comparison?) compare with each other. 

## Our dataset: COCO and Open Images V7

There are two essential criteria that a (...multimodal??) dataset must satisfy:

1. The dataset should be structured to have <query, multiple answers> pairs.
2. Both the "query" and "multiple answers" should include <image, text metadata>.

Publicly available datasets that meet these criteria are rare. The [Common Objects in Context](https://cocodataset.org/#home) (COCO) and [Open Images V7](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) datasets are notable exceptions. Both datasets are extensively utilized as benchmark datasets for object detection, segmentation, and image captioning tasks. 

COCO comprises images from 80 object categories, each accompanied by 5 unique, human-written captions that distinctively describe the objects present in the images. Open Images V7 encompasses a significantly larger number of distinct object categories - approximately 20,245. In addition to captions, Open Images V7 introduces Localized 
Narratives â€” a form of human audio description for each image segment, identified by mouse hovering. Each subpart of the Localized Narrative is accompanied by a timestamp. An illustrative example can be found [here](https://blog.research.google/2020/02/open-images-v6-now-featuring-localized.html). In this research, we leverage the textual representation of these Localized Narratives as captions. (...by converting the Localized Narratives to text?)

COCO and Open Images V7 permit us to fulfill our essential criteria; we can identify which images contain object sets (e.g., keyboard, mouse, person, TV) that appear only once in any particular image, and ensure that at least two images have the identical object set by excluding images with singular object sets - sets that appear only once. The Open Images V7 dataset is down-sampled by removing the outliers based on the frequency distribution of the label sets (= excluding images with object sets that appear only once). (...what about the COCO dataset? @mor). Following these transformations, the COCO and the Open Images V7 datasets contain 103,429 and 149,847 samples, respectively. (...how many outliers?)

Here's the reference image for the mentioned object set (=including outliers or whole COCO dataset?) from the COCO dataset, and below it, the human-written captions corresponding to each object set.

## Our embedding experiments

In our experiments below, we **vectorize/embed**, respectively, 1) image captions, 2) images, 3) both images and their captions, 4) images with multimodal vision transformers, 5) both images and their captions with multimodal vision transformers.. In cases where both images and their captions are used, the embeddings are concatenated. (...but you also experiment with concatenation in scenario 1)

After embedding the entire dataset and normalizing each vector to unit length (to avoid larger vectors biasing the learning), we **assess the quality of the embedding vectors by retrieving them and calculating ranking metrics**. More specifically. we iterate over the vector space and retrieve each vector's **_k (=10)_** nearest neighbors based on [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). Cosine similarity measures and quantifies the angle between two vectors by simplifying to a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) calculation after unit normalization.

For the retrieved vectors, we calculate ranking metrics using [Torchmetrics](https://lightning.ai/docs/torchmetrics/stable/all-metrics.html). Our primary focus will be on [Mean Reciprocal Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank) (MRR) and [Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain) (NDCG), both of which you can read more about [here](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/evaluating-recommendation-systems-map-mmr-ndcg). But we also use other information retrieval metrics like Mean Average Precision (MAP), Precision@k, and Recall@k, which are explained in detail [here](https://www.shaped.ai/blog/evaluating-recommendation-systems-part-1). In all of these metrics, the higher the ranking of relevant items/hits, the more effective the retrieval.

Now that we understand the basics, let's dive into each of our embedding experiments and their results. Afterwards, we'll put these results side by side to compare them.

### 1. Embedding Image Captions

In experiment 1, we vectorize image captions using the [Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library. We select top-performing models suiting our use case from [leaderboard](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html#sentence-embedding-models/) as well as [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers). In addition to using different models, we try different ways of processing our textual data:

- Concatenating the 5 human-written image captions (...@mor there are only 5 captions? or this refers to the 5 runs (models) which concatenate image captions) and embedding the combined text. All these runs are marked with a "_concat_captions" suffix in the table below.
- Randomly selecting one of the human-written image captions. All marked with "random."
- Using an AI model for generating captions, such as [Salesforce BLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12086.pdf), to compare AI-generated descriptions against human-written ones. You can find BLIP models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=Salesforce/blip).

We collected the results of experiment 1 in the table below, which presents the Run Name, metrics values, number of model parameters, model name, and **_top k_** retrieved vectors for evaluation, and a flag to indicate whether the caption is generated or not. 

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_embed_text_coco.png)

Utilizing all five human-written captions as a concatenation yielded the best results. The "all-distilroberta-v1," "bge-large-en-v1.5", and "e5-large-v2" models performed comparably well on MRR and NDCG metrics. The second best outcomes on average resulted from using a randomly chosen caption. Generating new captions with BLIP resulted in the lowest MRR scores. 

But do these outcome patterns hold true for the more diverse Open Images V7 dataset, which feature a broader range of objects and more descriptive Localized Narratives for each image? Let's take a look in the table below.

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_embed_text_oiv7.png)

BLIP-generated captions were more efficient than human Localized Narratives on the Open Images V7 dataset. Despite the previously mentioned models (...@mor, which ones?) maintaining their relative order, the "all-mpnet-v2" model claimed the top spot with an MRR score of 0.0662 (..@mor, incorrect; this is all-mpnet-base-v2's MAP score; MRR is 0.0706). Overall, the models performed similarly on generated captions, with slight variations attributable to the Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search using FAISS. (...@mor, which models/ which variations?)

When we used [LLaVA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08485.pdf) 1.5 to generate detailed descriptions (captions) for each image, the model tended to hallucinate non-existing objects at least 50% of the time. Performance improved when prompting for detailed descriptions for only those elements LLaVa 1.5 was confident about, but the model's one or two short sentences were no better than BLIP's output. We also looked at GPT-4, which performed well for all tested images. But GPT-4's current API limit means that it would take an estimated 2 weeks to re-caption an entire dataset, making it impractical.

Sentence Transformer models demonstrate consistent performance across diverse datasets. (...@mor what's the relationship between this and following sentence?) Generating captions with BLIP seems to be a viable option, especially when the captions provide a detailed description of each image. However, this fine granularity may reduce the retrieval capabilities of the system when such details are not essential, and the emphasis is on the overall concept.

### 2. Embedding Images with Larger Models

In our second experiment, we evaluate image embedding exclusively, and use [PyTorch Image Models](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models) (timm) to embed each image. We investigate how an increase in the number of model parameters impacts the quality of the embeddings and the subsequent evaluation results. We use [ImageNet leaderboard](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/results/results-imagenet-real.csv) within the timm repository serves to select models. We compare different sizes within the [EfficientNetV2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00298.pdf) family and include a [Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929v2.pdf) (ViT) and its variants for contrast.

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_embed_image_coco.png)

Achieving the highest efficiency, the [caformer_m36](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13452.pdf) model with approximately 56 million parameters attained an MRR score of 0.368. The EfficientNetv2 family, specifically the smallest model with around 21.5 million parameters, proved to be the second most effective method.

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_embed_image_oiv7.png)

The smallest EfficientNetv2 model claimed the first position on the Open Images V7 dataset, with the caformer_m36 model securing the second spot, followed by the EfficientNetv2 family models of sizes m and l.

The models' performance relative to each other remained consistent across datasets. Despite initial expectations of superior performance from the [Data-efficient Image Transformer models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877), attributed to their inductive biases from knowledge distillation, the experiments did not validate this assumption, resulting in these models occupying the last positions on both datasets.

### 3. Embedding Both Images and Their Captions

This approach integrates the embeddings from the first two scenarios using vector concatenation to form a combined embedding space. Here, we iterate through this space to retrieve the k nearest neighbors for each concatenated vector.

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_embed_text_image.png)

Combining vectors from **two unaligned vector spaces** by concatenation did not yield performance improvements over the Computer Vision models. Specifically, in the case of COCO, the Sentence Transformers' performance deteriorated to the level of the Computer Vision models. The forthcoming multi-modal experiments will explore the impact of jointly training text and image encoders, with an expectation that concatenating their results may enhance performance compared to using the vectors from either of the encoders.

### 4. Embedding Images with Multimodal Vision Transformers

In this scenario, we delve into models based on [Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf) (CLIP). CLIP models are unique for their multimodal approach, featuring separate but jointly trained Text and Image encoders. This joint training fosters a multimodal space where semantically similar concepts, regardless of being text or image, are positioned closer together in the embedding space.

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/clip.png)
[CLIP's high level architecture from the paper Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf)

The structure depicted in the image illustrates that the encoders are versatile and adaptable to various model architectures for embedding text or image data. For our experiment, we utilize pretrained models from the [OpenClip leaderboard](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip/blob/main/docs/openclip_results.csv) and apply the Image Encoder to embed the images, followed by an evaluation of the outcomes.

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_multimodal_vit_embed_image.png)


The performance of the tested models remained consistent across both datasets. ViT-based models outperformed the [ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)-based model on COCO, while on the Open Images V7 dataset, the difference was not as significant, despite ViT models having more than 4 times as many parameters. Additionally, we present results from BLIP, which utilizes a ViT model for image encoding.

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_multimodal_vit_embed_image_blip.png)

BLIP achieved the best MRR scores on both datasets, surpassing the OpenCLIP models, aligning with the findings in the BLIP paper. The larger BLIP model has parameters totaling 447 million, while the base model has 224.7 million parameters. Notably, the largest BLIP model reached MRR scores of 0.494 and 0.112 on COCO and Open Images V7, respectively.

### 5. Embedding both images and their captions with Multimodal Vision Transformers

In this final scenario, we leverage both the Text and Image encoders from the CLIP and BLIP models to encode the captions and images separately, then concatenate these embeddings. A key difference from scenario 3. is that, here, the encoders have undergone joint pre-training in the context of CLIP or have been aligned with additional layers in the case of BLIP.

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_multimodal_vit_embed_image_text.png)

The order of the ViT-based OpenCLIP models is interchanged in these experiments, but their performance remains comparable. Overall, the individual model's performance is roughly consistent on both datasets. In the BLIP experiments, these models once again prove to be more efficient, with the largest model reaching an MRR score of 0.4953 and 0.112 on COCO and Open Images V7 datasets, respectively. 

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_multimodal_vit_embed_image_text_blip.png)

In comparison to scenario 3, the concatenation of embeddings from two jointly trained or aligned encoders can boost retrieval performance. Upon observation of these datasets, the boost is more pronounced for OpenCLIP models.

### Comparison of All Results

Now, let's put all the results side by side for comparison.

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_all_scenarios_coco.png)

![](assets/use_cases/retrieval_from_image_and_text/table_all_scenarios_oiv7.png)

In both the COCO and Open Images V7 datasets, the BLIP and OpenCLIP models (vision transformer models) emerged as the most efficient feature extractors. On the COCO dataset, the BLIP model achieved comparable performance when utilizing only the image modality. In general it is established that utilising both the image and the captions will only marginally make the higher performing one (either best image-, or text embedding model) perform better. That might be because the caption and the image is referring to the same abstract notion and these models are doing a similarly good job encoding those. The top Sentence Transformers trailed by about 2% in MRR, but their inference speed is significantly faster. However, on the Open Images V7 dataset, the distinction was that the Sentence Transformers lagged behind the other models by around -37% in proportional MRR scores.

We should also take into account the inference time and GPU demands for each scenario. These metrics were gathered using an [RTX 3080 16 GB GPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-3080.c3621), capable of 29.77 TFLOPS on FP32. When processing the merged COCO training and validation dataset, containing 103,429 data samples post-preprocessing, we noted the following inference times and resource allocations. It's important to note that GPU utilization was always maximized through parallelized data loading to ensure efficiency.

- Embedding captions with "all-mpnet-base-v2" takes approximately 5 minutes and uses about 2.8 GB of GPU memory for batches of 128.
- Generating captions with "Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base" spans around 3 hours and requires close to 15.5 GB of GPU memory, also with batches of 128.
- Embedding images with "tf_efficientnetv2_s.in21k_ft_in1k" similarly takes about 3 hours and consumes 15 GB of GPU memory for batch sizes of 128.
- Embedding both captions and images using the OpenCLIP "ViT-L-14_datacomp_xl_s13b_b90k" model can be completed in about 50 minutes when processing with a batch size of 512, requiring 14.5 GB of GPU memory.

Indeed, if high-quality image captions are already in hand, employing Sentence Transformers for embedding proves to be highly efficient. This method offers a balance of speed and effectiveness. On the other hand, if only images are available and captions need to be generated, the process can be time-consuming, which could be a significant factor when deciding on the method for a given application or project.

## Questions for further investigation

The outcomes of these experiments open up several intriguing questions for further investigation. Here are a few key areas to explore:

1. A closer look at [various image-captioning models](https://huggingface.co/models?other=image-captioning) to assess the quality of captions they generate, particularly in relation to the size of the models. How does the caption quality vary with the complexity of the models?
2. How well does GPT-4 perform in the task of image captioning?
3. What criteria should be employed to appropriately evaluate the effectiveness of modalities and determine if captions effectively convey image content for retrieval purposes?

## Conclusion

The experiments conducted in this project demonstrate that Transformer models are highly effective feature extractors for both textual and image data. State-of-the-art image-captioning models have proven to be excellent in annotating images and ensuring consistency across similar concepts. ConvNets, with their inherent inductive biases, emerge as robust feature encoders for image data. Moreover, the use of jointly trained text and image encoders appears to offer significant advantages in data embedding tasks involving multiple modalities, compared to the using separately trained encoders and/or then combining them. Typically, BLIP and OpenCLIP models serve as reliable options for embedding data that involves both image and text modalities.

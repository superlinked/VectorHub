# Markdown Formatting

## Adding comments

If you want to add comments to your document that you don't want rendered to VectorHub frontend, you can use the following format to add comments to your markdown files. Make sure to have blank lines before and after the comment for best results.

```markdown
[//]: # (your comment here)
```

## Adding diagrams

You can use [mermaid](http://mermaid.js.org/intro/) to create diagrams for your content

## Adding Special blocks in archbee

Archbee supports special code, tabs, link blocks, callouts and changelog blocks which can be found in their documentation [here](https://docs.archbee.com/editor-markdown-shortcuts).

## Adding alt text and title to images

It is encouraged to add alt text (for accessibility & SEO purposes) and a title (for explanability and readability) to all images you add in a document.

```markdown
![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
```

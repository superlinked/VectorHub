# Contributing Guidelines

VectorHub is a learning hub that lives on its contributors. We are always looking for people to help others, especially as we grow. You can contribute in many ways, either by creating new content or by letting us know if content needs updating.

## How is VectorHub organised

VectorHub's content is organized into three major areas:

1. Building Blocks: These cover the broad field of vector creation and retrieval. We take a step by step approach to creating a vector stack: Data Sources -> Vector Compute -> Vector Search & Management.

2. Articles: This is where contributors can share examples of things they have been working on, research and solutions to problems they have encountered while working on Information Retrieval problems

3. Toolkit (coming soon): These are interesting apps, links, videos, tips, & tricks that aid in vector creation and retrieval.

## How to contribute

[This loom](https://www.loom.com/share/dd7f74501fa74740906910d7fb41e02e?sid=6ff5c716-ad70-43a2-968c-7f900b6fb613) explains how to set up your contributing workflow.

To summarise:
1. Fork the VectorHub repo
2. Push all commits to your fork in the appropriate section for your content
3. Open a PR to merge content from their fork to the remote repo (superlinked/vectorhub)

When contributing an article please include the following at the start:
1) One sentence to explain their topic / use case
2) One-two sentences on why your use case is valuable to the reader
3) A brief outline of what each section will discuss (can be bulletpointed)

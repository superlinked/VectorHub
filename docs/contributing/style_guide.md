# Style Guide

VectorHub is a community-driven learning hub; this style guide above all prioritizes communication between those members. We value and aim to create a platform for sharing your thinking and work. This guide therefore focuses on facilitating relevant communication. We care about grammar, but our priority is a generative conversation between members. We've set out ten "commandments" on what to aim for and avoid. The style guide is a short but living document that will evolve to meet community needs.

## Commandments
A list of commandments and a sentence about each in a bulleted form. Each commandment will be linked to a section below which gives some details about the commandment, examples etc.

# VectorHub Style Guide

VectorHub is a community-driven learning hub. Our style guide, therefore, aims to help you share your thinking and work. We care about grammar, but our priority is meaning. We want to generate productive conversation between community members. To this end, we've written ten "commandments" outlining some do's and don'ts.

## VectorHub's Ten Commandments

### [1 Give value to your readers](#section1)
`+` Who are you writing for and what problem are you solving?

### [2 Be clear and brief](#section2)
`+` Use simple language, short sentences, write only what's essential. 800-2500 words.

### [3 Be visual](#section3)
`+` Save a thousand words... Represent your ideas visually whenever possible.

### [4 Be conversational, friendly, and use action verbs](#section4)
`+` Write how you speak. Be personal. In an active voice.

### [5 Be hierarchical](#section5)
`+` Organize your content like a building, and show us the blueprint.

### [6 Cite all sources](#section6)
`+` Give credit where credit is due. Always.

### [7 Edit and proofread](#section7)
`+` Nail down your logic. Step back, outline, and revise. 

### [8 Technical terminology](#section8)
`+` It's an article about tech. Use relevant, familiar technical terms.

### [9 Accessibility](#section9)
`+` Hierarchize and tag.

### [10 Inclusive language](#section10)
`+` Your readers are diverse. Be non-biased and gender neutral.

### 1. Give value to your readers
<section id="section1">

Ask yourself why your article is **valuable** to your readers.
Set the context: identify your readers explicitly - say who your article is relevant to and why. What **problem** of theirs are you helping to **solve**?
Instead of this: "This latest software update is packed with helpful enhancements."
Write this: "Our November 15, 2023 update lets web developers optimize projects by developing faster with simplified coding."

Front load your first paragraph with **keywords**.

</section>

---
### 2. Be clear and brief
<section id="section2">

Write clearly and concisely. Aim for ["crisp minimalism"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/top-10-tips-style-voice).
Use simple language wherever possible; write like you speak.
Be minimal; less is more. Use **adjectives** only when they add value.

In general, aim for short sentences.

#### LENGTH
Articles must be **at least 800 but less than max 2500 words**.

Get the **substance** down **first**. Don't worry about making perfect sentences until after you've completed your article in point form. Fine-tuned, stylized prose can come later. First, make sure you've included everything that your article needs to make sense and convey value to your readers.

Use common **abbreviations** - e.g., "apps" instead of "applications"
Introduce unfamiliar abbreviations - e.g., "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)"

Skip **periods** on headings (only use them in paragraphs and body text).
Use last (Oxford) **commas** for clarity - e.g., "I love programming, data analysis, and web design."

Don't add extra **spaces** anywhere. One space between sentences and words.

</section>

---
### 3. Be visual
<section id="section3">

Use **diagrams**, **graphs**, **charts**, **code snippets**, **images** and any other visual tools that explain your work more efficiently.

</section>

---
### 4. Be conversational, friendly, and use action verbs
<section id="section4">

Write with a **friendly** tone. Call your audience "you", and yourself "we".

Use **contractions** - e.g., "I'm," "it's", "they're".

As much as possible, use an **active voice** to explain events and relationships - e.g., Instead of: "Deep neural networks are used by GPT to learn contextual embeddings." Write this: "GPT uses deep neural networks to learn contextual embeddings."

Choose specific action verbs over generic ones - e.g., Instead of: "We made changes to the code to improve performance." Write this: "We optimized the code to boost performance."

</section>

---
### 5. Be hierarchical
<section id="section5">

Add clear **headings** and **subheadings** that give information and an overview to your readers. This will enable readers to navigate to relevant sections and search engines to scan it.

Give an overview of where you're going in your Introduction.

Link (scroll-to-anchor) between concepts in your article (or to other articles on the platform) where it makes sense.

</section>

---
### 6. Cite all sources
<section id="section6">

Cite sources for all graphics, images, direct quotations, and others' ideas.
Use hyperlinks.

Source citations go underneath visual elements.

Punctuate outside of links - e.g., "We explain our approach in more depth [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/top-10-tips-style-voice)."

</section>

---
### 7. Edit and proofread
<section id="section7">

As early as possible (when your article is still in point form), go through it, summarize each paragraph in one (concise) sentence. Now, put all your summary sentences together and see if they tell a story. Is there a logical flow? If not, rearrange, remove, or add content until the article makes sense. In our experience, going through this exercise saves a lot of time and energy. It's also a good way of checking whether your headings and subheadings are accurate.

Whenever possible, find an industry-specific reader.

</section>

---
### 8. Technical terminology
<section id="section8">

You're writing a technical article. Use technology-specific terminology. If you think the thing you're describing is unfamiliar to most readers, it probably is. Feel free to link to external resources that provide more in-depth explanations of terms you do not have space to explain in your article.
In general, don't overcomplicate your text; communicate as simply and clearly as possible.

</section>

---
### 9. Accessibility
<section id="section9">

Improve accessibility by creating headings and subheadings that are clear and accurately describe your content.

Include alt text for all images and graphics.

</section>

---
### 10. Inclusive language
<section id="section10">

Avoid words and phrases with negative connotations; remember your audience is international and heterogeneous. Err on the side of **caution** - if you think a term might be offensive, don't use it.

Avoid **stereotypes** and **biases**.

Use **gender neutral pronouns** - e.g., instead of he/his/him or she/hers/her, use they/them/their.

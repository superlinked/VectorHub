# Style Guide

VectorHub is a community-driven learning hub. Our style guide, therefore, serves primarily to help create a platform for sharing your thinking and work. We care about grammar, but our priority is generating productive conversation between community members. To this end, we've written ten "commandments" outlining what to do and what not to do.

## Commandments
A list of commandments and a sentence about each in a bulleted form. Each commandment will be linked to a section below which gives some details about the commandment, examples etc.

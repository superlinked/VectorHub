# Contributing

VectorHub is a learning hub that lives on its contributors. We are always looking for people to help others, especially as we grow. You can contribute in many ways, either by creating new content or by letting us know if content needs updating.

## How is VectorHub organised

VectorHub's content is organized into three major areas:

1. Building Blocks: These cover the broad field of vector creation and retrieval. We take a step by step approach to creating a vector stack: Data Sources -> Vector Compute -> Vector Search & Management.

2. Use cases: We have 7 use cases that map out how the vector retrieval can be utilized in production apps.

3. Tools: These are interesting apps, links, videos, tips, & tricks that aid in vector creation and retrieval.

# Contributing

VectorHub is a learning hub that lives on its contributors. As it keeps growing, we always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either by creating new content or by checking if content is upto date.

## How is VectorHub organised

The content on VectorHub itself falls into three major areas:

1. Building Blcks: These cover the broad area of vector creation and retrieval. It is based on a step by step approach in creating a vector stack. Data Sources -> Vector Compute -> Vector Search

2. Use cases: 7 use cases which map to how the vector retrieval can be utilized in production apps.

3. Tools: These are interesting apps/links/videos/tips & tricks that aid in vector creation and retrieval.

## Conclusion 

Building an effective vector retrieval stack requires a deep understanding of its objectives,  available data sources, and how these interact in the context of your retrieval system.

In this article, we learned how to map your data infrastructure and identify the key inputs to your vector retrieval stack. Only a careful mix of structured & unstructured data, delivered in batch and/or in real-time as needed, will enable you to reach your desired retrieval quality and latency while keeping your engineering complexity manageable.

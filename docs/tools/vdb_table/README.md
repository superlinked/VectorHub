# Vector DB Comparison

![](../../assets/tools/vdb_table/cover.gif)

[Vector DB Comparison](https://vdbs.superlinked.com/) is a free and open source tool from VectorHub to compare vector databases. It is created to outline the feature sets of different VDB solutions. Each of the features outlined has been verified to varying degrees.

This is a community initiative spearheaded by [Dhruv Anand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruv-anand-ainorthstartech/), Founder of AI Northstar Tech, to give visibility to the different VDB offerings. Following the initial launch of the benchmarking table, a group of collaborators (listed below) was formed to verify claims before publishing on VectorHub.

[VectorHub](https://hub.superlinked.com/) is a community-driven learning platform for information retrieval hosted by [Superlinked](https://superlinked.com/). Superlinked is a vector compute solution in the ml stack alongside the different VDBs. 

For this exercise, the collaborators have worked with points of contact from the VBDs to ensure neutrality and fairness to create an accurate tool for practitioners.

### About this repository

- **Frontend:** The frontend is created in React, using ag-grid for the tables and Material UI for the interface components. It's hosted and deployed using Vercel.
- B**ackend:** This github serves as the data for the table. Any updates to the JSON files are validated using github actions and pushed to a Google storage bucket, from where the frontend fetches the data.
- **Discussions:** All the vendors have a dedicated discussion [here](https://github.com/superlinked/VectorHub/discussions/categories/vdb-comparison). Please ensure to go through the discussions before raising an issue/PR.

| File                  | Description                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `vendor.schema.json`  | JSON Schema file that describes the attributes, it's properties, and description |
| `vendorX.json`        | All the attribute data for vendor X. We have one file per vendor.    |


Attributes inside vendorX.json has the following properties
- `support`: Whose values can be `[ "", "none", "partial", "full" ]` indicating on confidence levels, for that attribute support. NOTE: Each change where a "support" claim is being added MUST include  either i) a reference to documentation, ii) an example of the functionality being described, or iii) a link to the actual code implementing the specific functionality.
    - `""` means the cell will be blank. 
    - `"none"` means the cell will have a ‚ùå. 
    - `"partial"` means the cell will have a üü®.
    - `"full"` means the cell will have a ‚úÖ.
- `value`: `license` and `dev_languages` have this property to support values about license details and languages (as a list).
- `source_url`: To provide documentation links, or evidence supporting the attribute values. It is shown as the 'external link' button in the cell.
- `comment`: Any other useful information that will be shown on hover and with the info icon.
- `unlimited`: `doc_size` and `vector_dims` can have this property set true if they support unlimited values.

For more nuanced information about each property, have a look at `vendor.schema.json`.

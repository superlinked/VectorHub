# Manifesto

To make sure we can stay active and engaged, we've decided to follow these guiding principles for VectorHub. These principles are designed to both guide and highlight our commitment to creating a quality resource for developers to use practically to both experiment with and launch products using vector retrieval. 

## Practicality

Getting stuff to production is more than launching “cool demos”. Hence, it becomes imperative to

* Evaluate vendors and models in realistic ways, not random synthetic benchmarks.

* Consider latency & cost as proper infrastructure needs to be fast and affordable. It is not acceptable to be waiting *seconds* for queries.

[Data Sources](building_blocks/data_sources/readme.md), [Vector Search](building_blocks/vector_search/readme.md) have in-depth reviews of vendors and models.

## Composition

Full-stack LLM application builder tools are like a black-box, it's hard to figure out what happens under the hood and impossible to control it properly. Hence, we believe that building your stack from atomized components turns out to be far superior and fits your needs well.

:::hint{type="info"}
[Building Blocks](building_blocks/readme.md) is how we compose the literature around creating vector stacks.

## Anti-hype

We don’t want to make content /*just/* about LLMs or “build a chatgpt for your data”. Vector retrieval has far more use cases like recommender systems, fraud, computer vision and beyond.

:::hint{type="info"}
[Use cases](use_cases/readme.md) is a dedicated space for the myriad ways in which vector retrieval is used.

## Together we're better

We're here to learn and support each other as this space develops. This is a safe space and there are no stupid questions. Submit your feedback using the feedback button at the bottom of each page or email support@superlinked.com with the subject line "VectorHub feedback". The more we ask, test and experiment, the better we become

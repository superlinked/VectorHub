# Manifesto

To ensure that we stay active and engaged, we've put together some guiding principles for VectorHub. These principles embody and highlight our commitment to creating a practical, high quality resource that developers can use to experiment with and launch products using vector retrieval. 

## Practicality

Getting stuff to production takes a lot more than launching “cool demos.” It's imperative to - 

* Evaluate vendors and models in realistic ways, not random synthetic benchmarks.
* Prioritize low latency & cost as baseline infrastructure prerequisites. We want speed and affordability. It is _not_ acceptable to be waiting *seconds* for queries.

[Data Sources](building_blocks/data-sources/introduction), [Vector Search & Management](building_blocks/vector-search/introduction) have in-depth reviews of vendors and models.

## Composition

Full-stack LLM application builder tools are like a black box, it's hard to figure out what happens under the hood and impossible to control it properly. As a result, we believe that building your stack from atomized components is far superior. It's transparent, and you can configure it to meet your needs.

[Building Blocks](building-blocks) is where we put together and revise literature around creating vector stacks.

## Anti-hype

We don’t want to make content /*just/* about LLMs or how to “build a chatgpt for your data.” Vector retrieval is much broader, and includes far more use cases, like recommender systems, fraud, computer vision, and beyond.

[Articles](all-articles) is a dedicated space for the myriad ways in which vector retrieval is used.

## Together we're better

We're here to learn and support each other, as we develop this space together. This is a safe space and there are **no** stupid questions. Submit your feedback using the feedback button at the bottom of each page, or email support@superlinked.com with the subject line "VectorHub feedback." The more we ask, test, and experiment, the better we become. Let's do this!

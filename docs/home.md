# Let's learn about Vectors!

VectorHub is a free and open-sourced learning hub for people interested in adding vector retrieval to their ML stack. On VectorHub you will find practical resources to help you -

* Create MVPs with easy-to-follow learning materials
* Solve use-case-specific challenges in vector retrieval
* Get confident in taking your MVPs to production
* Learn about different tools and vendors for your use-case

Read more about our philosophy in our [Manifesto](manifesto.md).

<!-- ## Toolbox

Toolbox is a collection of benchmarks, code snippets, summaries, and tricks to help you decide what's best for your use case. These are tools that we and our community use frequently. We use your input to curate our toolbox. So, feel free to share some tools that you use often or have created recently that will help the community. You can do that by [creating an issue](https://github.com/superlinked/VectorHub/issues/new).
